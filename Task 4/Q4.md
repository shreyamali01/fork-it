## Question 4
We use the same models as we did in Task 3 to maintain consistency. We used one example of every activity class from our collected data to train the model. We query the model on our collected data. The data collected from Manav was used to train the model, while the data collected from Arul was used to test it. This was done to ensure there is no data leaking.<br>
The `llama3.1-8b` model had the same performace as with the model trained on the UCI-HAR dataset, but the `llama3.1-70b` model's performace significantly improved as such<br>
`llama3.1-8b :`<br>
`Accuracy: 0.50, Precision: 0.31, Recall: 0.50`<br>
`llama3.1-70b :`<br>
`Accuracy: 0.83, Precision: 0.75, Recall: 0.83`<br>
