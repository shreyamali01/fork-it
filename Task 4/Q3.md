## Question 3
We use the same models as we did in Task 3 to maintain consistency. We used one example of every activity class from the raw accelerometer data to train the model. We query the model on our collected data. We chose this specific data from the UCI-HAR dataset to match the data shape.<br>
The `llama3.1-8b` model was able to predict only one test sample correctly, while the `llama3.1-70b` model predicted 3 out of 6 correctly. The metrics are as such<br>
`llama3.1-8b :`<br>
`Accuracy: 0.17, Precision: 0.08, Recall: 0.17`<br>
`llama3.1-70b :`<br>
`Accuracy: 0.50, Precision: 0.33, Recall: 0.50`<br>
We repeated the experiment with 2 examples per activity class for training, and the performance of both the models dropped. The `llama3.1-8b` model predicted all test samples incorrectly, while the `llama3.1-70b` model predicted only one correctly.<br>
`llama3.1-8b :`<br>
`Accuracy: 0.00, Precision: 0.00, Recall: 0.00`<br>
`llama3.1-70b :`<br>
`Accuracy: 0.17, Precision: 0.04, Recall: 0.17`<br>
