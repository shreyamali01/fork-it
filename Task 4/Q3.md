## Question 3
We use the same models as we did in Task 3 to maintain consistency. We used one example of every activity class from the raw accelerometer data to train the model. We query the model on our collected data. We chose this specific data from the UCI-HAR dataset to match the data shape.<br>
Both the models were able to correctly predict 3 out of the 6 test data given, making their accuracy 50%. The metrics are as such<br>
`llama3.1-8b :`<br>
`Accuracy: 0.50, Precision: 0.33, Recall: 0.50`<br>
`llama3.1-70b :`<br>
`Accuracy: 0.50, Precision: 0.31, Recall: 0.50`<br>
We repeated the experiment with 2 examples per activity class for training. The `llama3.1-8b` model had the metrics as `Accuracy: 0.67, Precision: 0.56, Recall: 0.67`, while the `llama3.1-70b` model's performace got worse with metrics as `Accuracy: 0.17, Precision: 0.06, Recall: 0.17`.
